### Reagents

* Transformation Salts with Glycerol (TG salt solution)
  * 75 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>
  * 6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>
  * 15% glycerol
* Super Optimal Broth for Ralstonia (ROB)
  * 1 g Casamino acids
  * 15 g Bacto-Peptone
  * 1 g Yeast extract
  * 0.93 g KCl
  * 0.95 g MgCl<sub>2</sub>
  * 1.20 g MgSO<sub>4</sub>
  * Water to 1000 mL
* Super Optimal Broth with Catabolite Repression for Ralstonia (ROC)
  * 1000 mL ROB (sterile)
  * 20 mL of 20% (w/v) Glucose (sterile)

### Procedure (for single transformation)
1. Growth
    1. Streak out Ralstonia strain on CPG+TZC agar and incubate at 28°C for two days or room temperature for three to four days.
    2. Select a single colony and add to 5 mL CPG broth and incubate overnight in shaker incubator at 250 rpm and 28°C.
    3. Measure OD of overnight culture.
    4. Dilute overnight culture to OD 1, then serial dilute to OD 0.001.
    5. Add 100 µL of OD 0.001 culture to 5 mL ROB.
    6. Incubate in shaker incubator at 250 rpm and 28°C for ~20-21 hours, until the subculture reaches exponential phase (OD 0.2-0.6).
        * For slow growing strains, either plan to let them grow for more time or inoculate with 100 µL of OD 0.01 culture instead.
2. Preparation
    1. Perform all steps on ice except for centrifugations.
    2. Incubate subculture on ice for 10 min.
    3. Add 1 mL subculture to a chilled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
    4. Centrifuge for 30 sec at 13,000 xg and pipet off supernatant.
    5. Repeat steps 2iii and 2iv in the same microcentrifuge tube to increase the cell mass in the pellet.
    6. Resuspend pellet in 1 mL cold 100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.
    7. Incubate on ice for 20 min.
    8. Centrifuge for 30 sec at 13,000 xg and pipet off supernatant.
    9. Resuspend pellet in 1 mL cold TG salt solution.
    10. Incubate on ice for 15 min.
    11. Centrifuge for 30 sec at 13,000 xg and pipet off supernatant.
    12. Resuspend in 100 µL cold TG salt solution and keep on ice until use.
3. Transformation
    1. Add plasmid DNA and 100 µL chemically competent cell suspension to a chilled 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube.
    2. Incubate on ice for 15 min.
    3. Heat shock in a water bath at 45°C for 2 min.
    4. Incubate on ice for 15 min.
    5. Repeat steps 3iii and 3iv two additional times for a total of three heat shock steps.
    6. Add 500 µL ROC and incubate in shaker incubator at 250 rpm and 28°C for 4 hours.
    7. Label the plates and put them in the incubator at 28°C so that they are warm when it is time to plate out the cells.
    8. Plate cells onto prewarmed plates containing selective media.
        * Plate out 100 µL of solution and any desired dilutions.
            * Generally, a 1:10 dilution will be enough.
        * Optional:
            * Centrifuge remaining solution for 1 min at 13,000 xg and pour off supernatant.
            * Resuspend in 100 µL water and plate out the 100 µL volume.

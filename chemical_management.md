## Chemical Inventories

General information:
1. Chemical Inventory (requirements by EHS at UC Davis): 
    * All chemicals must be entered into the online **chemical inventory**. https://ehs.ucop.edu/chemicals/
    * If the chemical has never been in the lab, and it is a mutagen/carcinogen, acute toxin, flammable, or any other sort of hazardous chemical, the appropriate chemicals SOP must be updated to include any handling or storage practices needed for the new protocol. 
    * All chemicals must have a **QR code sticker** (to validate the inventory annually)
         * We have an In/Out system to add/remove QR stickers to chemical bottles and add/remove their listings in the chemical inventory. There are plastic buckets labeled "new chemicals" and "empty chemicals" in Room 275 on the "package receiving" area of the lab (close to the hallway door). **The Safety Person is responsible** for adding/remove chemicals once per month.
            * When a chemical gets "empty", dispose of it appropriately.
               * Non-hazardous: rinse with water 3x. Scribble on the label with thick black marker. Throw in normal trash.
               * Hazardous: Place in the fume hood in 286. Arrange for disposal by chemical safety as needed.  
         * For chemicals in 4C and -20C storage, the QR stickers won't be able to adhere to the cold bottles (condensation). These labels will be stored on the fridge/freezer in a pouch. 

1. Label bottles with "open [date]" upon opening.  
    * Only 1 bottle per chemical should be open at a time. 
    * Replacement bottles will be stored in the "overstock" area. 

Annually, the building safety coordinator will audit our chemicals by scanning the QR codes. So please make sure you don't forget to put anything back! :)

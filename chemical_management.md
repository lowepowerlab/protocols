## Chemical Inventories

General rules:

1. Label bottles with "open [date]" upon opening.  
    * Only 1 bottle per chemical should be open at a time. 
    * Replacement bottles will be stored in the "overstock" area. 
2. For hazardous chemicals (flammables, reproductive toxins, carcinogens, etc.), UC Davis requires us to:
    * Keep an online inventory located at https://ehs.ucop.edu/chemicals/ 
    * Attach a QR barcode sticker to each bottle. 
    * For chemicals in 4C and -20C storage, the QR stickers won't be able to adhere to the cold bottles (condensation). These labels will be stored on the fridge/freezer in a pouch. 
3. When a chemical gets "low", check the overstock area for more.  Then request a new bottle be ordered if nothing is in overstock.  
4. When a chemical gets "empty", dispose of it appropriately.
    * Non-hazardous: rinse with water 3x. Scribble on the label with thick black marker. Throw in normal trash.
    * Hazardous: Place in the fume hood in 286. Arrange for disposal by chemical safety as needed. 

Annually, the building safety coordinator will audit our chemicals by scanning the QR codes. So please make sure you don't forget to put anything back! :)

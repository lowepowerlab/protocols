## Culture and Maintenance of plant pathogenic *Ralstonia*

### Colony Morphology
*Ralstonia* colonies are fluidal, mucoid and irregular in shape.  On CPG+TZC plates, the colonies have a white or light pink appearance, with dark pink or red centers.  Colonies should not be visible until 36-48 hours after streaking at 28˚C.  Colonies that are visible by 24 hours are not *R. solanacearum*. 

*R. solanacearum* strain GMI1000 growing on TZC plates at 28˚C for 55 hours:

#### Beware of spontenous phc mutants
CAUTION: Beware of small, round, dark red, non-mucoid colonies surrounded by reddish-brown melanin pigment.  Ralstonia solanacearum spontaneously forms avirulent mutants, especially after storage in waterstock. (These are usually mutated in the Phc quorum sensing system.)

### Misc. Advice

* Do not store *Ralstonia* at 4C or above 35C. 
    * If you want to halt growth on dilution plates, you can store them at 4C short term. 
* Keep plates of *Ralstonia* for no longer than 1 week before restreaking the strain from a glycerol stock. 
    * Do not repeatedly transfer bacteria from plate-to-plate. They will evolve. 
* When using erlenmeyer flasks, keep broth volume less than 50% of the flasks "capacity" to ensure proper aeration and growth of the bacteria. If you need more bacteria, use a larger flask or multiple flasks.

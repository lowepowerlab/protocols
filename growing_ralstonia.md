## Culture and Maintenance of plant pathogenic *Ralstonia*

**Essential Reading**: [Kelman 1954 *Phytopathology*. "The relationship of pathogenicity in *Pseudomonas solanacearum* to colony appearance on a tetrazolium medium".](resources/Kelman_1954_essential_reading.pdf)

*Note: *Ralstonia solanacearum* was referred to as *Pseudomonas solanacearum* up until 1990s, was briefly called *Burkholderia solanacearum*, and then the *Ralstonia solanacearum* species complex. Work by Prior, Fegan, and others split the complex into 3 species: *Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum* (all phylotype I and III strains, including GMI1000), *Ralstonia solanacearum* (all phylotype II strains like K60, AW1, UW163, and IBSBF1503), and *Ralstonia syzygii* (all phylotype IV strains like PSI07, R24, and the "banana blood disease" strains).

### Colony Morphology
*Ralstonia* colonies are fluidal, mucoid and irregular in shape.
On CPG+TZC plates, the colonies have a white or light pink appearance, with dark pink or red centers. 
Colonies should not be visible until 36-48 hours after streaking at 28˚C. 
Colonies that are visible by 24 hours are not *R. solanacearum*. 

*R. solanacearum* strain GMI1000 growing on TZC plates at 28˚C for 55 hours:

#### Beware of spontanenous phc mutants
CAUTION: Beware of small, round, dark red, non-mucoid colonies surrounded by reddish-brown melanin pigment. 
*Ralstonia* spontaneously forms avirulent mutants, especially after storage in waterstock. (These are usually mutated in the Phc quorum sensing system.)

### Misc. Advice

* Do not store *Ralstonia* at 4C or above 35C. 
    * If you want to halt growth on dilution plates, you can store them at 4C short term. 
* Keep plates of *Ralstonia* for no longer than 1 week before restreaking the strain from a glycerol stock. 
    * Do not repeatedly transfer bacteria from plate-to-plate. They will evolve. 
* When using erlenmeyer flasks, keep broth volume less than 50% of the flasks "capacity" to ensure proper aeration and growth of the bacteria. 
If you need more bacteria, use a larger flask or multiple flasks.

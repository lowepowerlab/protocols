# Dilution plating to measure colony forming units (cfus)

## General Notes:
* **Determine how you will normalize the raw colony counts**, and record relevant units. 
    * CFUs/g plant tissue --> make sure to weigh plant tissue pre-homogenization. See [Colonization of tomato stems protocol](col_tomato_stem.md)
    
* **Estimate your cell density** if possible. 
If you know the range of CFUs that you expect, you can save yourself a little effort & some plates. 
Plate 1 or 2 dilutions higher/lower than the dilution you expect to have countable colonies. 
    * If dilution plating plant samples, plate the 10^0 to 10^-7 dilutions. Wilt-symptomatic plants have >5x10^8 cfu / g stem, 
* **When in doubt, plate a large range of dilutions**. 
Make sure you catch the range of cfus. 

### Prepare your workspace
1. Check consumable levels in advance: 
    * 200 ul tips (1 box per 12 samples) - autoclaved
    * 96-well **round-bottom** microplate (1 per 12 samples) - sterilized in 10% bleach 30 min, 4x thorough rinses with diH2O (ensure bleach is removed from plate), dried in 50C oven... or new microplate.
    * Agar plates (e.g CPG + TZC). 
    *Plates should be fairly dry (but not cracked & agar should not be completely dried to agar plate surface) or else the droplets will merge on the plate.  If plates are poured same-day, let them dry in the laminar flow hood with lids ajar for ... 1 hr?* 
1. Load microplate with dilution liquid
    * Pour diH2O (Ralstonia) or buffer (any bacteria) into a sterile reservoir (autoclaved glass petri dish or plastic petri dish).
    * Using multichannel P200, add 180 ul diH2O or buffer

### Dilute samples:
* *If laminar flow hoods are occupied, dilution and plating can usually be done on the open bench without significant contamination. 
Contaminating fungi usually originate from (plant) sample*
1. Add 20 ul of sample (10<sup>0</sup> dilution) to 180 di H2O in row A (10<sup>-1</sup> dilution). 
    * *If sample is homogenized tissue, make sure 20 ul is transfered--it's possible for plant debris to clog tip. 
    Gently pipette to relieve clog. 
    An accurate 20 ul will come to the 20 ul line without bubbles*
1. With multichannel P20, THOROUGHLY pipette to mix row A (~10 pipette pulses), and transfer 20 ul to row B. 
Mix THOROUGHLY again and discard tips. 
1. Continue down plate, discarding tips after mixing each new row. 
    * *Tip*: If you lose your place, look at the microplate from the side for the row with 200 ul, which will be noticeably higher than the 180 ul rows. 
    * *Tip*: If you are unsure your pipette-to-mix skill is adequate, practice with a colored solution like 0.1% crystal violet, DNA loading dye, or even chlorophyll-pigmented plant homogenate. 
1. Plate dilutions:
    * Decide how many samples you can fit onto an agar plate.  You will be plating a rectangular array of dots onto a circle.  Arrays that work well:
        * 3 x ??
        * 6 x 6
    * Orient agar plates in a consistent manner (helpful to diagnose technical errors with dilution plating).
    1. Moving from most dilute (e.g. row H) to least dilute (row A, then sample, if 10^0 sample should be plated), use the P20 multichannel to plate **8 ul**. 
        * Avoid letting droplets merge. If they do merge, plates are too wet. Discard the plate & try again with a drier plate. 
        * If minor errors are made (innacurate volume pipetted or droplets merge), gouge the agar with the your tip at those spots & use agar area around that. 
    1. Allow drops to absorb into agar. 
1. Incubate 28 C for ~2 days (40 h is best) or 3 days on the bench before counting colonies.  
    * *The mucoid colony morphology can cause the colonies to merge; count colonies before that happens. 
    A sweet spot of 1 day at 28 C & 1 day at room temp can be helpful*

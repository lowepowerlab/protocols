## General Information
For plates, add 15 g Agar / L and a stir bar. Cool in the 55 °C bath prior to pouring, until the media can be touched with bare hands. Add [antibiotics](antibiotics.md) if required. Stir for approximately 1 min, then pour.

All recipes are reported as per L

## Minimal Media

### (BMM) Quarter-Strength M63 Medium
BMM stands for Boucher's Minimal Medium after the researcher who determined that this Na-free medium was suitable for *Ralstonia* growth. BMM is a conveniently short label for your bottles.

*Note*: This medium has a low-buffering capacity so depending on final pH of medium, Tris or MES can be added (50 mM final concentration). 

Prepare:

|           Amount | Reagent                                   |
|-----------------:|:------------------------------------------|
|            3.4 g | KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>              |
|            0.5 g | (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>|
|         see note | with dI H<sub>2</sub>O                    |

First dissolve components in ~700 ml dI H<sub>2</sub>O. 
Then adjust pH to 7.0 with 5 N KOH (*Ralstonia* is Na-sensitive). 
Then bring up to 1000 ml. 
Dispense 100 ml into bottles. 
Autoclave. 

Then add the following sterile solutions (**per 100 ml**)

|   Amount | Reagent                                     |
|---------:|:--------------------------------------------|
|    10 ul | 1.25 mg/ml FeSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O |
|   517 ul | 1 M MgSO<sub>4</sub>                        |

Add carbon source at 10 mM final (e.g. 10 ml of sterile 1 M stock per L )

#### 1.25 mg / ml FeSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O solution 

    * Prepare 10 mls at a time:
        * 12.5 mg into 10 ml dI H<sub>2</sub>O  
        * Filter-sterilize (0.22 um syringe filters)
    * Aliquot < 1.4 ml into 1.5 ml tubes
    * Store at -20 C.
    * Only open in laminar flow hood

#### 1 M MgSO<sub>4</sub> 
    * MW (MgSO<sub>4</sub>): 120.36 g/mol 
    * Weigh **6.018 g**
    * Dissolve in dI H<sub>2</sub>O up to 50 mls
    * Autoclave to sterilize
    * Only open in laminar flow hood

# Making media

### General information

* Rich media components (e.g. peptone, casamino acids, yeast extract) are dusty & scum up the inner workings of the sensitive microgram scale (surrounded by cover), so use the less sensitive scale.
* Wear gloves while making media
* When making media to be autoclaved, make sure the volume of the container is twice that of the amount of media you are autoclaving (i.e. if you are making 1 L of media, make it in a 2 L bottle/flask to autoclave it)
  * Too small of a container will result in boil-over
* Clean the media preparation area when finished making media
  * Dust off the scale / make sure its doors are closed

### Liquid media
1. Make media and measure out in 100 mL aliquots into milk dilution bottles
2. Put lids on bottles loosely (don't close all the way or else pressure may cause explosion)
3. Fold edge of autoclave tape (for easy removal) and place on seam between lid and bottle. 
4. Put bottles in square metal cage 
    * *Note*: This might need updating depending on autoclave type in building
5. [Autoclave](autoclave.md)
6. After autoclaving, let bottles cool at room temperature until you can touch them with bare hands, then tighten the caps.
   * Important to tighten caps after cooled, or else they will get stuck on.
7. Put media away on designated shelf.

### Plates
1. Make media in appropriately sized flask with stir bar if pouring same day
    * *Alternatively*: Make in appropriately sized bottlw without stir bar. 
    This can be re-melted in the microwave at a later point.
2. Add 15 g agar per 1 L of media (makes 1.5% agar plates)
3. Cover top of flask with aluminum foil and place autoclave tape on top
    * Or loosely cap bottles, as with liquid media.
    * Generally make solid CPG as 500 ml in 1 L bottles and keep shelf stocked with solid LB at both 250 ml in 500 ml bottles and 500 ml in 1 L bottles
4. Turn on 55°C water bath.
4. [Autoclave](autoclave.md)
    * For storage of solid media in bottles, label with lab tape (folded edge):
        * Media type
        * Date made
        * Your initials 
    * Or re-melt media in microwave. ***xxxSomeone should update this with recommendations on power settings / time for both CPG and LB. The salts in LB make it likely for LB to volcano in the microwave if you aren't careful.*** 
5. After autoclaving, immediately place media in 55°C water bath and wait until cool enough to touch with bare hands (~30 min for 1 L vol)
    * *If re-melting solid media in bottles*, follow this as well.
    * Don't let molten media sit in waterbath overnight.
    It will spoil 
6. When ready to pour plates, place flask on stir plate and stir at low speed (~200 rpm) so bubbles aren't produced
   * If making plates with [antibiotics](media.md#antibiotics), add antibiotic to flask at this point and let stir for ~1 min
7. Set up plates for pouring; keep the plastic sleeve the plates come in to store the poured plates
   * Use scissors to open sleeve of plates closest to the top seam (to get the most length out of the sleeve for reuse)
   * Stack plates in sets of 5 and line up on bench top
8. Light Bunsen burner
9. Take flask off of stir plate and pour media into plates
   * Pour just enough to cover the bottom of the plate
   * Pour gently so as not to create bubbles
   * Make sure to put lid back plate on immediately after pouring
   * If bubbles end up in plate, quickly pass flame from Bunsen burner over surface of media to pop bubbles
10. When all the media has been poured, immediately rinse out flask with hot water (so the residual media doesn't solidify), turn off the water bath, turn gas off of Bunsen burner
11. Label the sides of the plates with permanent marker according to the guide at the plate pouring bench (i.e. LB is one blue line)
12. Leave plates out at room temperature for 1-2 days to solidify and dry out along with a piece of tape labeled with the media type (wors or color code), date, and your initials
13. After the plates are solidified, place them in a labeled plastic sleeve and place in the cold room on the appropriate shelf

### Antibiotics

* [Antibiotic stocks](antibiotics.md) are kept in the -20°C freezer in a labeled box.
* The numbers on the tubes of antibiotics refer to the concentration of antibiotic in mg/mL.
* Antibiotics should be added to media AFTER autoclaving and after the media has cooled to a usable temperature (or else the antibiotics could degrade).
* Fully thaw antibiotics and vortex to mix just before adding them to media
* Allow the media to stir for ~1 min after adding antibiotics. 
    * If using re-melted agar from a bottle, add an autoclaved stir bar *after* fully re-melting agar.
* For amount of antibiotic stock solution to add, reference the antibiotic chart at the plate-pouring bench or the ['antibiotic_workbook.xlsx'](workbooks/antibiotic_workbook.xlsx).

# Preparing Sterile Lab Supplies

***XXXTo update: a few things denoted with ~~ to cross them out***

## General information

* Wear gloves when preparing supplies for sterilization
* Autoclave and labeling tape should be dog-eared to aid in removal of tape
* When closing containers with aluminum foil:
  * Foil should be double layered (take a big piece and fold it in half)
  * Make sure foil is large enough to generously cover container (foil goes >1 inch down *all* sides)
* [Autoclave protocol](autoclave.md)

## Microfuge tubes

* There are several different sized microfuge tubes: 0.5, 1.7, and 2 mL.
    * Note, we often call the 1.7 ml tubes "1.5 ml tubes".
* Put tubes in pint and quart mason jars. 
    * Do not overfill.
* Cover top of jar with aluminum foil.
* Place autoclave tape on seam between foil and container.
* [Autoclave](autoclave.md).

## Pipette tips

* There are 3 sizes of pipette tips. 
We refill boxes of for autoclaving: 10/20 uL, 200 uL, and 1200 uL.
* Pipette tip refills come in wafers that can just be inserted into empty tip boxes.
* When boxes are filled and ready to autoclave, put a piece of autoclave tape on seam between the lid and bottom of the box.
* Any tip box waste (empty wafers, plastic package the refill wafers come in) can be put in designated cardboard box for recycling.
* Autoclave.

## Culture tubes

* Put culture tube caps on glass ~~16 mm culture tubes~~.
* Put capped culture tubes in ~~square metal cage~~ for autoclaving.
* Place piece of autoclave tape on the ~~square metal cage~~ (don't need to individually tape the tubes).
* Autoclave

## Glass beads

* Add glass beads to ~2/3 volume of the bead bottles. 
* Cap the bottles loosely.
* Put a piece of autoclave tape on seam between the lid and bottle.
* Autoclave.

## Long sticks

* If new tubes need to be made:
  * Fill 16 mm glass tubes about 1/2 to 2/3 full of long sticks.
  * Cap the tubes.
  * Put tubes in square metal cage for autoclaving.
  * Place piece of autoclave tape on the ~~square metal cage~~ (don't need to individually tape the tubes).
  * Autoclave.

## Toothpicks

* There are two types of toothpicks we use: flat and round.
* Generally, lab members will use a set of toothpicks, then foil, label, and autoclave tape them when they are finished.
* If new sets of toothpicks need to be made:
  * Fill a small plastic beaker with toothpicks (leave some room for ease of use).
  * Flat picks need to go into the beaker big end down.
  * Place aluminum foil over beaker.
  * Label top of foil using Sharpie with "F" for flat or "R" for round toothpicks.
  * Place autoclave tape on seam between foil and container.
  * Autoclave.

## Glycerol tube stocks

* There are 3 types of glycerol tube stocks we use: red-, yellow-, and white-capped tubes
* Red-capped tubes get filled with 600 uL of 50% glycerol, yellow- and white-capped tubes get filled with 300 uL of 50% glycerol
  * [50% glycerol recipe](media.md#glycerol-50-vv)
* Place tubes in Wheaton rack
* Unscrew tube caps but leave caps on the tubes
* Add glycerol to tubes
* Loosely screw caps down (not all the way)
* Place autoclave tape on top of rack of tubes (don't need to individually tape tubes)
* Autoclave
* After autoclaving is finished, let tubes cool and then screw down caps all the way

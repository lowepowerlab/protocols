# Onboarding

Important information for new hires. We highly recommend getting a UCD email address before arriving.  This will allow you to complete online safety training before arriving in the lab. 

In addition to the content here, the [Maloof lab](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/wiki/) at UC Davis has some great information.

## Before you work in the lab
A lot of this information applies throughout your tenure in the Lowe-Power lab. 

### Safety

http://plantpathology.ucdavis.edu/safety.cfm

* UCD **Online safety training** through (LMS)[https://lms.ucdavis.edu/] aka UC Learning Center. Look for the courses below in `Required Training`. If you do not see them, use the `Find A Course` search. If all else fails, email the plant pathology Safety guru Andy Ross (abross@ucdavis.edu) to request the training and copy Tiffany. These trainings are long, but that is because they cover safety in sufficient detail to be useful. Although it's technically possible to "test out" of the training with the quiz, I expect you to watch the videos in full with your full attention and then completing the quiz. 

    1. eCourse:UC Laboratory Safety Fundamentals (Initial Training)
    1. eCourse:UC Laboratory Safety Fundamentals Refresher  
    1. eCourse:Cryogen Safety 
    1. Proper Handling of Materials at Biosafety Level 1 
    1. UC DAVIS BIOSAFETY LEVEL 2 ONLINE TRAINING
    1. Safe Use of Biological Safety Cabinets

* **Department Safety Training**. Navigate to to the Department's Safety website. Familiarize yourself with the contents.  Review and sign the following documents (XXX Note: We need to clarify with Andy Ross how to Read/sign these since we aren't required to keep paper copies)
    * Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP)
    * Emergency Action Plan (EAP)

* **Lab-Specific Safety Training**. Before experiments begin in the lab, you'll need to go through the initial safety training with the lab's safety coordinator. 

* **Safety questions**.  It is important to identify safety risks and work with Tiffany, labmates, and EH&S to identify safe ways to proceed. Bring up all safety concerns on the lab's Slack (there is a #safety channel) to open a discussion. Public discussion will help your labmates also adopt safety best-practices.

* **Lab-safe clothing**--make sure you have appropriate attire:
    * **Shoes**: closed-toe, closed heel. Non-absorbant material is *strongly* recommended. 
        * Need inspiration for smart-looking shoes that are also lab safe? Check out online communities: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=lab+shoes&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search?q=lab+shoes&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all). 
    * **Pants / other bottoms**: Between tall socks, leggings, or pants, you'll need to ensure you don't have skin exposed. 
    * Avoid clothing that is too drapey & could fall into a bunsen burner / beaker of bacteria / etc. (Especially trendy sleeves on shirts)

### Where to find administrative help (HR, Purchasing, Travel, IT, etc)

The Plant Pathology dept shares admin staff with the Entomology & Nematology depts. They are named the Phoenix Cluster. Familiarize yourself with [the Phoenix Website](https://phoenix.ucdavis.edu/)--especially the links to the side of the page. Also, you might have reasons to direct questions to a specific department (e.g. HR, Purchasing, Travel, IT, etc.), so you can find their (mailing lists here)[https://phoenix.ucdavis.edu/departmental-mailing-lists]. The staff's offices are located on the 3rd floor of Hutchison and in Briggs Hall, and they are friendly people who can help you with walk-in questions. 

Tiffany and current lab members can also point you in the direction of an admin to help you solve your problems. 

## Lab Organization 

* **Lab Notebooks** are property of the lab and will digital and be backed up regularly (Bonus--you can keep a copy to use as a reference when you leave the lab!). I recommend using Microsoft OneNote and following the practices recommended here. https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006918 I suggest labbies use the YYYY/MM/DD datestamp format because it's easiest to sort numerically. 
    * If you make scratch paper notes, take photos & attach it to your notebook.  Same with scratch calculations in excel -- screenshots. If you are transitioning from a paper labnotebook, you can also use photos --> OneNote as an interim solution. 
    * Notebook should be completed by the end of the week. 
    * Notebook should be backed up monthly to the cloud (automatically preferred).
    * Although your data is the property of the lab, a digital lab notebook is in your best interest.  You'll always be able to look back at the methods you optimized & potentially write your papers on a beach / coffee shop / ski lodge in Tahoe. 


* **Lab protocols** are hosted on Github: https://github.com/lowepowerlab/protocols. 
    * Create a Github account for yourself and apply for an [academic account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-for-an-educator-or-researcher-discount) to have the option of private repositories. I expect all repositories to be shared within the lab and any validated data or protocol to eventually be publicly published and shared with the scientific community. 
    * As we optimize/improve/change protocols, please commit updates to the shared lab protocols, and list yourself as a contributer. 
    * Github allows us to have version control on protocols, so it's possible to retrieve previous versions of protocols. 

* **Strain lists:**. Work-In Progress strains/plasmids should be kept in personal freezer boxes, which is a short-to-medium term storage. Once validated I expect strains & plasmids to be added to the core strain inventory (detailed in the ["Glycerol stocks" lab protocol](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/protocols/blob/master/glycerol_stocks.md)). All validated plasmids should be added to a core folder on the lab's Benchling account. 
    * I encourage everyone to do monthly audits of their strains and make sure any confirmed strains are moved to the permanent collection & incorrect strains are put in biohazard waste. 

## Software / Website recommendations (all)

### Slack 
* Slack will be our lab's preferred communication tool (to keep it separate from noisy email boxes). I encourage labbies to install the Slack desktop app and smartphone apps and create an account to access LowePowerLab.slack.com
* I encourage everyone to set "Quiet Hours" when Slack will not push notifications to your phone. You are not expected to respond to lab communication during non-work hours. 
* Not all channels will be default, but you can click on "Channels" to add yourself to channels. 

### Electronic lab notebook -- OneNote
* We are currently evaluating OneNote App (Not OneNote 2016, which will be discontinued by microsoft) as a platform for your electronic lab notebook. It's available for Windows, Macs, iPads, and Android OS. 
* I recommend reading [A quick guide for using Microsoft OneNote as an electronic laboratory notebook](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006918). Consider using keywords and tags in your notebooks because OneNote's search is pretty powerful. 
* While you are transitioning from a paper-lab notebook & when you need to take paper notes -- feel free to take photographs of your notes/notebook pages & embed them into OneNote pages. 

### Benchling
* Benchling will be our lab's cloning / short DNA management software.  
    * Create an (academic) account and request access to the organization: https://benchling.com/organizations/lowepowerlab/members
    * Keep "cloning plans" in your notebook.  Once you create & validate a vector, copy it to the shared inventory. 
        * XXX to add -- best practices example of a good cloning plan. 

### Box -- Cloud Back-Up
**You *must* back up your data**. UC Davis pays for unlimited storage through Box (a Dropbox competitor). Once you have a UC Davis "Kerberos" account, you can use your UCD credentials to log into [Box at ucdavis.box.com](ucdavis.box.com). Your data is the property of the lab, and it must be backed up.  Please Set up a lab-notebook folder and set Box to watch & sync that folder. Make sure this folder is shared with the lab Box organization (XXXFigure this out & describe it better)

Good things about Box:
* **Version-Control** -- (Tiffany) accidentally deleted 40 pages of my PhD thesis without noticed & then saved changes.  Because I was working from a Box-synced folder, I was able to go back to the web interface of Box and download previous iterations of my thesis to find that text. 
* **Shared-Access** -- Please make all of your data accessible to the lab, but especially Tiffany. 

Drawbacks of Box:
* It only syncs one folder. For this reason, save all of your lab material in that folder
* **Sync Speed** -- it can be slow to sync files (minutes). 
* **Multiple People Issues** -- If 2 people have a document open, edit it, & save their changes, box creates 2 files that a human then has to manually merge the changes. This is most likely a problem when co-writing a paper with your PI. If it's a word Doc the "Compare" feature in "Review" can cut down on how annoying this problem is. 

### Google Drive
UC Davis pays for google services accounts.  We have a "Team Drive" called the "Lowe-Power Lab Drive".  Make sure you are added to this.  This is where we keep documents that all users will want to view (and most will want to edit).

### Managing the Literature 

#### Reference Management Software
They are all flawed, but nonetheless superior to manually curating citations in your papers, grants, theses, etc. This software both serves as a paper database (local, but you )

Options include Mendeley, Zotero, Endnote, and more. I encourage use of the free ones (so ... not EndNote). 

(If the lab comes up with a great solution, please update this section)

#### Recommended Reading list 
We have a hive-mind Google Doc that will morph as the lab interests ebb and flow. This document will serve as a potential starting point for new lab members to dive into the literature.  While a lot of the papers are *Ralstonia* related, we'll also put in other bacteria/microbe-interactions papers that might inspire our work.   

You can request read (part-time labbies) and edit (full-time labbies) access to the [Recommended Reading doc here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P-1xsSmAvdl-zBIPTzegvSQwl7Bo9lA3qmXo16owYDA/edit#heading=h.jhbq16rd80b).

## Software recommendations (full time labbies only)

### Graphpad Prism
* Graphpad Prism: Full time staff should ask Tiffany how to get a license. (Unfortunately, we don't currently have funding to purchase licenses for undergraduate researcher's computers).  We are currently using this software for graphing & basic statistics, but my hope is that we will develop competencies for open-source graphing and statistics (e.g. Python/Pandas/Seaborn or R)

### Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
* Probably useful for a lot of new territory that the lab is going into. But definitely good for updating the lab Github pages. [See here](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/protocols/blob/master/git_and_github.md#set-up-a-text-editor-on-your-computer)

## Non-essential software

* [ACD Chemsketch](https://www.acdlabs.com/resources/freeware/chemsketch/) - Chemistry drawing program. (There's also a UCD license to ChemDraw, but it's a very bloated program & you probably don't need all the features.)

* [BioRender](https://biorender.com/) -- Quick biology diagrams. Unfortunately, they only export as JPGs on the free version. You should avoid JPGs for graphs / text / cartoons because of the compression.  PNG and TIFs have better compression for line-art. 

* Mac-Users: [Spectacle]: Split your screen / resume fullscreen with keystroke commands. (This function is built into Windows OS)

# Purchasing lab materials

Account information is in the Lab Google Drive "Accounts/Passwords - lowepower lab". Please don't share this information outside of the lab. x`

## Local shop 
XXX-update with location information

great for gloves, etc.

## SWAP -- 


## Try to use AggieBuy & punch-outs

## Shipping Address
355 Hutchison Hall
Davis, CA 95616

# Living in Davis

## Places to find short-term rentals (< 1 yr>)

This will take effort. Davis is a small college town & the rental market is heavily tied to the academic year.  We should try to time short-visits to academic year (operates on quarter system [Find dates on UCD website](https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/calendar/quarter)). Housing will be cheapest over summer quarter when undergrads vacate apartments. 

There are a few Communities where you can find open rooms:
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/286762898448011/ UC Davis Housing--Grad/Professional Students
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/763250590497811/ UC Davis Off-Campus Housing

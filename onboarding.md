# Onboarding

Important information for new hires. We highly recommend getting a UCD email address before arriving.  This will allow you to complete online safety training before arriving in the lab. 


## Before you work in the lab

### Safety

http://plantpathology.ucdavis.edu/safety.cfm

* UCD **Online safety training** through (LMS)[https://lms.ucdavis.edu/] aka UC Learning Center. Look for the courses below in `Required Training`. If you do not see them, use the `Find A Course` search. If all else fails, email the plant pathology Safety guru Andy Ross (abross@ucdavis.edu) to request the training and copy Tiffany. These trainings are long, but that is because they cover safety in sufficient detail to be useful. Although it's technically possible to "test out" of the training with the quiz, I expect you to watch the videos in full with your full attention and then completing the quiz. 

    1. eCourse:UC Laboratory Safety Fundamentals (Initial Training)
    1. eCourse:UC Laboratory Safety Fundamentals Refresher  
    1. eCourse:Cryogen Safety 
    1. UC DAVIS BIOSAFETY LEVEL 2 ONLINE TRAINING
    1. Safe Use of Biological Safety Cabinets

* **Department Safety Training**. Navigate to to the Department's Safety website. Familiarize yourself with the contents.  Review and sign the following documents (XXX Note: We need to clarify with Andy Ross how to Read/sign these since we aren't required to keep paper copies)
    * Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP)
    * Emergency Action Plan (EAP)

* **Lab-Specific Safety Training**. Before experiments begin in the lab, you'll need to go through the initial safety training with the lab's safety coordinator. 

## Lab Organization 

* **Lab protocols** are hosted on Github: https://github.com/lowepowerlab/protocols. 
    * Create a Github account for yourself and apply for an [academic account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-for-an-educator-or-researcher-discount) to have the option of private repositories. I expect all repositories to be shared within the lab and any validated data or protocol to eventually be publicly published and shared with the scientific community. 
    * As we optimize/improve/change protocols, please commit updates to the shared lab protocols, and list yourself as a contributer. 
    * Github allows us to have version control on protocols, so it's possible to retrieve previous versions of protocols. 

* **Strain lists:**. Work-In Progress strains/plasmids should be kept in personal freezer boxes, which is a short-to-medium term storage. Once validated I expect strains & plasmids to be added to the core strain inventory (detailed in the "Glycerol stocks" lab protocol). All validated plasmids should be added to a core folder on the lab's Benchling account. 
    * I encourage 


## Software recommendations (all)
* Slack will be our lab's preferred communication tool (to keep it separate from noisy email boxes). I encourage labbies to install the Slack desktop app and smartphone apps and create an account to access LowePowerLab.slack.com
* Benchling will be our lab's cloning / short DNA management software.  
    * Create an (academic) account and request access to the organization: https://benchling.com/organizations/lowepowerlab/members
    * Keep "cloning plans" in your personal folders.  Once you create & validate a vector, copy it to the shared inventory. 

## Software recommendations (full time labbies)
* Graphpad Prism: Full time staff should ask Tiffany for a license. (Unfortunately, we don't currently have funding to purchase licenses for undergraduate researcher's computers).

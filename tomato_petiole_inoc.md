### 1. Preparation of Plants

#### Sowing Seed 
Sow seed 3 weeks before inoculation date. 
1. Add potting soil ***XXXtype to be determined*** to a plastic seedling insert in a tray.
    * Break up large clumps of soil.
1. Wet the soil & gently compress it. 
1. Sow tomato seed at 3-5 seeds per insert well.  
    * Space the seeds out. Otherwise the roots will be tangled and difficult to separate. 
1. Cover the seeds with additional soil and wet soil. 
1. Label the tray with your name, sowing date, and tomato genotype.
1. Place the tray in the XXX growth chamber (28 C) and water regularly. 

#### Expectations for plant growth:
* Expect seeds to germinate and emerge from soil at XXX days
* After emergence, the first true-leaf should appear by XXX days. 
* Germination frequency should be >80 %. 

#### Transplanting
2 weeks post-sowing, transplant the seedlings to individual XXX inch pots. Plants should be at 2 leaf/petiole stage.  If you are inexperienced with petiole inoculations, transplant extra plants in case you maul one. 

1. Prepare XXX inch pots with potting soil.  Fill pots with loose soil. Wet the soil. With your index finger, make a hole in the center of the pot. 
1. Separate the seedlings:
    1. Tip: The soil should be moist, but not wet. If the soil is wet, it will aggregate and the weight will cause excessive root tearing. If the soil is dry to cracking, it will cause similar, but less severe root damage.
    1. Choose plants of equal size to transplant. 
    1. Remove each insert well in a way that minimizes root tearing: Gently push from the bottom while pulling the cluster of stems upwards.  
    1. To detangle the roots, you will need to loosen the soil. Alternatingly roll the root ball between the palms of your hands and gently shake/pat them until it's possible to tug the seedlings apart with minimal root tearing. 
1. Pot 1 seedling per pot. 
    1. Place each seedling into the soil so that the roots are buried, but that the stem is above the soil-line.
    1. Compact the soil toward the seedling to stabilize the seedling (*Use both hands to compress the soil from 4 directions around the stem of the plant*). Then compact the rest of the soil downwards. 

#### Avoid weird plants
* Plants with 2 true leaves and a lack of a meristem
* Plants with mottled leaf color

#### Expectations for plant growth:
* By 3 weeks post-sowing, the plants should be at the 3-4 leaf stage. 

### 2. Prepare bacterial inocula

1. **Day 0** - Three days prior to plant inoculation, plate the relevant bacterial strains on CPG agar.
    * If plates are kept moist (generous agar layer without cracking), you can plate out the bacteria up to 6 days before inoculation. 
1. Incubate bacteria at 28Â°C for 2 days.
1. **Day 2** - Inoculate 3 ml CPB broth in a glass culture tube with one colony of each *Ralstonia* strain for infection. Prepare duplicate tubes as backup.
1. **Day 3** - Pellet 1 ml of culture (>10k *xg* for 1 min) and resuspend in dI H2O. Measure and record the OD600 of a 1:10 dilution. 
1. Plants will be inoculated with 2 ul bacterial suspension for a target inoculum of ~1000 CFU, so prepare a suspension at 
5x10<sup>5</sup> CFU / ml. Using a conversion of OD = 0.2 equals 1x10<sup>8</sup> CFU / ml, adjust the bacterial concentration to 5x10<sup>5</sup> CFU / ml.  The ['bacterial_density_workbook.xlsx'](bacterial_density_workbook.xlsx) may help you. 
    * *Note*: You may need to validate the OD to CFU/ml conversion when working with new wildtype backgrounds or EPS- mutants. 
    * Depending on research question, you might change the target inoculum density.

### 3. Dilution plate to confirm the inocula

1. Label CPG plates to plate samples of the inoculum. 
1. For inocula of 1x10<sup>3</sup> CFU / plant, inoculum is 5x10<sup>2</sup> CFU / ul. Serially dilute to 10<sup>-3</sup> and plate 3 technical replicates of 10 ul droplets of the 10<sup>-3</sup>, 10<sup>-2</sup>, and 10<sup>-1</sup>. 
1. Incubate at 28C for 2 days or on the benchtop for 3 days before counting colonies.  Use the ['bacterial_density_workbook.xlsx'](bacterial_density_workbook.xlsx) to calculate and verify inoculum density    

### 4. Cut-petiole inoculate the plants
Note: Empirically, inoculations are more uniform if the soil is dry and plants are watered after inoculation.

* ***Importantly***, the petiole must be dry or else capillary action will draw the inoculum droplet down the outside of the plant before it can enter the xylem.

1. Label the plants, either with plastic stakes in the soil or with lab tape on the tray: Initials, date, & experimental variables.

1. Per plant, locate the oldest (lowest) true leaf. This petiole will be the inoculation site. In batches of 5, use a sharp razor blade to remove the petiole leaving a horizontal pedestal wound such that ~2 mm of the petiole remains. 
    * *Note*: Take care to only cut the petiole and to not damage the main stem. *It's best to **keep the blade steady** next to the target cut site and to **pull the petiole into the blade***. This ensures that when the cut is complete, the plant pivots away from the blade. If you move the blade towards the petiole, you are likely to cut into the stem after cutting the petiole.
1. With a P2, add a 2 ul droplet of bacterial suspension to the wound-pedestals.  
    * *Note*: [Reverse pipetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_pipetting) is recommended for increased accuracy when pipetting small volumes. 
    * The droplet should sit on the pedestal. If it immediately disappears/is drawn down the side of the stem, dry the pedestal and sides of the stump with a kimwipe and repeat the inoculation. For sensitive assays, discard plants (biohazard trash) where inoculation needs to be repeated.
    * Within 5 min, the droplet should be sucked into the xylem. Avoid disturbing the plants before the droplet enters the xylem. With care, you should be able to gently move plants without disturbing the droplet.

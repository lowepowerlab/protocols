*Note, this needs to be updated with site-specific information* ~~this~~ indicates information that needs to be updated/verified. 

1. Before autoclaving, make sure:
   * Everything being autoclaved has autoclave tape on it (the tape indicates if items have been properly sterilized).
   * Any screw-on lids are loosely screwed onto any bottles going into the autoclave (if screwed down all the way, bottles could explode during the autoclaving process).
2. Load items to autoclave into autoclave bin.
   * Liquid and dry items are autoclaved seperately.
   * 4 L of liquids max
   * Don't stack liquids, but you can stack dry items.
3. Place the autoclave bin into the autoclave.
   * Biohazard bags shouldn't be touching the sides of the autoclave. 
4. Shut autoclave door and fully secure.
5. Select the proper protocol from the menu.
   * Press "Select cycle", scroll to correct protocol, press "enter" to view protocol
   * Liquids:
      * 500 mL: ~~P13 liq LIQUIDS1~~ (15 min exposure time)
      * 1-1.5 L: ~~P15 liq LIQUIDS1~~ (20 min exposure time)
      * 2-3 L: ~~P14 liq LIQUIDS1~~ (30 min exposure time)
      * 4 L: ~~P14 liq LIQUIDS1~~ (40 min exposure time)
   * Dry: ~~P8 grav GRAVITY1~~ (30 min exposure time)
   * Biohazardous waste: ~~P8 grav GRAVITY1~~ (30 min exposure time)
6. Press "Start" to start cycle.
7. ~~When cycle is finished, autoclave will ring~~
8. If autoclaving liquids, take items out of autoclave
   * Wear protective *dry* gloves and be careful--items will be very hot. 
   Be especially careful around the lids of liquid media where steam (>100C) can escape and cause steam burns *through autoclave gloves*
   * If autoclaving media with agar for pouring plates same-day, immediately put media in 55Â°C water bath.
   * For other liquids (including bottles of solid media to be re-melted later), leave out at room temperature
9. If autoclaving dry items, transfer to 50 C drying oven to dry (typically overnight)
10. If autoclaving liquids, immediately rinse out the autoclave bin with hot water to clean out any boil-over
11. If autoclaving biohazardous waste:
   * If there is a lot of boil over, place autoclaved bag into another biohazard bag, dump the boiled over liquid into the bag as well, tie the bag closed for disposal
   * ~~To dispose of autoclaved bags, put a green "OK to trash" sticker labeled with our lab name and room number on the bag, then place bag in big black trashcan in autoclave room~~
   * ~~Make sure the big black trashcan isn't too full; if it's full, take the bag out, tie it closed, label with an "OK to trash" sticker, and set the bag to the side of the trashcan~~

# Buffers and Reagents

## General Notes

You might not be comfortable with chemical calculations yet.  Knowing which equation to use to make a certain buffer seems challenging when you are new to the lab, but chemical calculations are a muscle that you need to exercise. 
When in doubt, C1V1=C2V2. Don't feel embarrassed if you need to quickly google to assure yourself of something (*"What does % w/v mean again?"*). 
Aim for self-sufficiency, but ask your mentor for help after you've put in an honorable effort. 

After you can do the calculations by hand, feel free to use the **['chemistry_calc_workbook.xlsx'](workbooks/chemistry_calc_workbook.xlsx)** to check your math & avoid mistakes. 

## Don't take Buffers for granted

When working with a new buffer, make sure you understand its properties. 
Buffers have a limited dynamic range (there's no perfect buffer for all pHs). 
Some buffers change pH with temperature. Some damage our pH probe.

# Common Buffers

## 50x TAE
**Purpose:** Stock solution for DNA electrophoresis (dilute to 1x before use).

| Amount     | Reagent              |
|-----------:|:---------------------|
|     242 g  | Tris Base            |
|     57.1 g | Acetic acid, glacial |
|     100 ml | EDTA (0.5 M pH 8.0)  |
| to 1000 ml | dI H<sub>2</sub>O    |

Glacial acetic acid is irritating, so open & dispense in fume hood. 

Store at room temperature. 
Dilute 1:50 before use in gel electrophoresis (as running buffer or solvent for agarose gel)

**Worth considering**: There are some other fancy running buffers that are supposed to speed up gel run-time without compromising quality. 
Feel free to test those & make them the lab SOP. 

## EDTA 0.5 M, pH 8.0
`ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid`

1. Dissolve **18.61 g** of disodium EDTA (MW = 336.21) in 80 mL water.  
1. Adjust pH to 8.0 with NaOH.
*Note: EDTA will not go into solution until the pH is approximately 8.0.*
1. Adjust volume to 100 mL with dI H2O.  Aliquot and autoclave.



## Tris pH 8.0  (50 mM)
**Purpose:** for DNA stability (e.g. for reconsituting primer stocks).

*Note:* Many pH probes can be damaged by Tris, so mixing the proper ratio of Tris Base and Tris HCl to achieve a 50 mM buffer at the desired pH.  
The ratio below yield a solution that is pH 8 at 25 C. See manufacturer's protocol if a different pH from 7.0 to 9.0 is desired. 

`Trisma Base: tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane)` MW = 121.14

`Trizma HCl: tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane hydrochloride` MW = 157.6

| Amount    | Reagent           |
|----------:|:------------------|
|    1.11 g | Trizma HCl        |
|   0.663 g | Trizma Base       |
| to 250 ml | dI H<sub>2</sub>O |

Prepare in glass beaker with stir bar. 
Stir on magnetic stir plate until dissolved.
Aliquot into 50 ml conicals, and place on Buffers/Media shelf. 
*Note: Everyone should keep a vial for personal use.* 

# Common Reagents

## Glycerol (50% v/v)

In a 1 liter graduated cylinder mix:

| Amount | Reagent           |
|-------:|:------------------|
| 500 ml | glycerol          |
| 500 ml | dI H<sub>2</sub>O |

Seal with parafilm and invert until mixed. 
*Note: Glycerol is very viscous, so make sure it mixes completely and does not stick to the container.*
 
Dispense 100 ml aliquots into milk dilution bottles and autoclave.

## TZC (1% w/v)
**Purpose:** Redox indicator for CPG agar (forms red precipitant in respiring cells). 
Useful indicator for *Ralstonia* colony morphology. 

`2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride`

| Amount | Reagent           |
|-------:|:------------------|
|    2 g | TZC               |
| 200 ml | dI H<sub>2</sub>O |

Filter sterilize (0.2 um filter) 50 ml a time into 50 ml conical tubes. 
If careful, you can use the same filter for the whole batch.

Wrap with ~single layer of foil (TZC is light sensitive).
Label and date tube. 

## IPTG (100 mM)

`isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside`

| Amount | Reagent          |
|-------:|:-----------------|
| 238 mg | IPTG             |
|  10 ml | ddH<sub>2</sub>O |

Filter sterilize (0.2 um filters), then store 0.5 ml aliquots at -20 °C.

Add 1 μl IPTG solution per 1 ml agar for a final concentration of 0.1 mM.
If spreading on plate, consider that a typical plate agar volume is 25 ml.
Dispense 75 μl sterile water on the plate containing ~10 beads, add 25 μl IPTG to the plate, then shake to distribute evenly.

## Xgal (20 mg/ml)

`5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside`

| Amount | Reagent                                    |
|-------:|:-------------------------------------------|
| 200 mg | Xgal                                       |
|  10 ml | *N,N*-dimethylformamide (Dispense in hood) |

Mix in Corning *polypropylene* 15 mL tube. Wrap tube in foil as Xgal is light-sensitive. 
Note that *dimethylformamide dissolves some plastics* (e.g., polystyrene conical tubes).

Mix well and store at -20°C.

Add 100 μl to agar plates for β-galactosidase assays.

The most uniform distribution in an agar plate is accomplished by adding Xgal to the liquid agar after the media has been autoclaved and can be touched (~60 °C), then mix well prior to plating. 
Alternately, if Xgal is spread on a plate directly, pipet onto multiple foci and use 10 glass beads to distribute it rapidly before it sets into local areas of the plate.

## DAP (300 mM, 1000x)

`Diaminopimelic acid`
MW = 190.19

| Amount | Reagent          |
|-------:|:-----------------|
|  1.14g | DAP              |
|  20 ml | ddH<sub>2</sub>O |

At this concentration, the DAP will not go into solution, so aliquot quickly after mixing. 
Autoclave, then store at room temp.  

Vortex before adding to media.

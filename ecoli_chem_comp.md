# Mix & Go Chemically Competent E. coli
**Writing/editing credits:** XXX

Follow the ZymoBroth Mix & Go Transformation Kit protocol. 
Make a large batch. 
Cells should be "good" for > 1 yr if stored at -80C.

## Controls with each batch:
  * Negative Control: Plate residual cells on antibiotic plates to ensure there's no contamination.
  * Positive Control: Transformation with xxx ng of xxx plasmid
  * First person to make in Lowe-Power lab -- create a lab & link to spreadsheet to record parameters... # tubes created, whether cells passed negative control, & # colonies. 
  Also, flesh out a brief protocol for the + control experiment.

## Important notes:
* Growth temperature: Generally the cooler the growth temperature, the slower the E. coli grow, which dramatically improves competence.
  * Lowe-Power lab has a room-temperature shaker incubator that should be used for competent E. coli.  
* Growth medium ... to be determined in our own hands.  
We have ZymoBroth. 
First person in the lab gets to compare that to LB & update this protocol with a note about (1) relative efficiency of the resulting cells (2) how long it took cells to reach the proper OD for harvesting. Thanks!

## Things to look out for when growing your tomatoes

### Plant pathogens we didn't intend to use

### 1. Tobacco mosaic virus

Detecting TMV:
1. Be aware of symptoms
1. Think "source to sink" and choose "sink" leaves for testing with Agdia TMV immunostrips (follow manufacturer's instructions) 
1. If positive result... all the seed in that packet will be contaminated.  Bleach sterilize surfaces that came in contact with the seed.  Store seed pouch inside a ziploc bag to prevent cross-contamination. 

1. Decontaminate seed:

    1. Gently shake seeds in 50% bleach for 1.5 hr. 
    1. Rinse well in water to remove bleach
    1. Resuspend seeds in water. Immediately use a metal spatula to carefully sow them into wet potting soil.
        *The bleach treatment will remove the seed coat and the exposed endosperm is very fragile*
    1. Cover the seeds with potting soil and wet. 
    1. All seed in the same

# Nile Red PHB Quantification Protocol
1. **Day 1:** Streak out wild-type and knockout on CPG+TZC plates, incubate at 28C for two days.
1. **Day 3:** Make three overnight cultures from each plate using 5mL of CPG broth and a different colony for each culture tube. Incubate in shaker incubator overnight at 28C and 250rpm. Include a negative control.
1. **Day 4 *(~24h later)*:** Check the OD of the cultures. Dilute cultures to an OD of 0.001 using water and a serial dilution method: original to 1 to 0.1 to 0.01 to 0.001. Add 100µL of diluted culture to 5mL of CPG broth in new culture tubes. Incubate in shaker incubator overnight at 28C and 250rpm.
1. **Day 5 *(ex-p. ~20h, st-p. ~26h)*:** Check the OD of the cultures to determine phase. Prepare 1.7mL suspensions with 0.2 OD from each culture by diluting with water.
    1. Add 100µL of suspension per well in a 96-well plate. Repeat for each technical rep. Save and use for dilution plating.
    1. Pellet the remaining suspension at 10,000rcf for 5 minutes. Pipet off the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1mL of water.
    1. Add 60µL of 80µg nile red/1mL DMSO to each suspension and incubate in the dark for 45 minutes. Make a blank.
    1. During incubation, do dilution plating.
        1. A row: 100µL of suspension in each well, completed in step 4i.
        1. B-H rows: 180µL of water in each well.
        1. Transfer pattern: 20µL from A to B, B to C, and so on.
        1. On CPG+TZC plates: 8µL from rows E-H.
        1. Incubate plates at room temperature for 2-3 days.
    1. After incubation, add 200µL of suspension per well in a black-walled 96-well plate. Repeat for each technical rep. Include the blank.
    1. Use the microplate reader with the black-walled 96-well plate and the nile red measurement setting.
1. **Day 7/8:** Check the dilution plates and count colonies.

### Notes

1. For each trial, use freshly diluted nile red from a concentrated stock that is not older than two months.
1. "ex-p" means exponential phase and refers to an OD of 0.4-0.6.
1. "st-p" means stationary phase and refers to an OD of 2+.

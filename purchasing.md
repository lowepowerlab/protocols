## New large $$ purchases (>$3,000)
* Reach out to sales representatives and ask for a competitive quote -- get quotes from several manufacturer's / vendors to bargain for the best price.
* If they won't lower the list price to < 40% of list price, then negotiate for complimentary consumables. 
* Limit the # of face-to-face meetings or phone calls during the negotiation.  Your time is valuable, so aim for email or phone. 

## New Lab deals we need to negotiate:
* NEB -- First order will be 40% off list price.  We'll need RE, Assembly Mix, maybe ladders
* Zymo -- First order will be 50% off. If we also do $850, we get a free $200 starter kit.  We'll consider if this is worth it.

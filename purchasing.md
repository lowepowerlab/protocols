# General Rules

Typically we have one or two people who carry the "lab job" of ordering supplies. When items get low, please post them to the #ordering channel on our Slack. If it's a routine item, it is helpful to post a picture of the "product number" or "item number" so that it can be searched on the ordering databases. The Ordering person should place orders at least weekly. 

* **Do not openly publish the lab's financial information to the internet**. Store private information either in the "Lab Management" folder in Box Sync database or in a Google Sheet that is shared with the lab. 
* Purchase items with the correct funding string. Ask on #ordering Slack channel if you are confused.

# Purchasing lab materials

## AggieBuy
The system for buying most things. 
* http://aggiebuy.ucdavis.edu
* Be very careful that you are buying the correct item.
* Only a few suppliers are directly linked on the "Aggie Buy" search. We often have to use the "PunchOuts" for items. If prices seem "high", then search the item on a few of the PunchOuts to compare. If prices seem "way cheaper than expected", then pay attention to the amount. It might be "shrinkflation" (i.e. 50 gloves instead of 50 pairs of gloves...). Generally, 
  * Buy chemicals through FisherScientific, VWR, or MilliporeSigma.  
  * Buy most plastic consumables through Genesee. This is listed directly on AggieBuy.  Our lab Account on the Genesee website has a "favorites" with many of the Genesee brands we usually buy.
  * Primers: Although IDT is on AggieBuy, we should buy directly through the IDT.com website. 

## VetMed Storeroom 
* Located in Haring Hall.  
* Has lots of consumables in case we run out. But buying cases of consumables through AggieBuy is usually more cost-effective.

## New large $$ purchases (>$2,000)
* Reach out to sales representatives and ask for a competitive quote -- get quotes from several manufacturer's / vendors to bargain for the best price.
* If they won't lower the list price to < 40% of list price, then negotiate for complimentary consumables. 
* Limit the # of face-to-face meetings or phone calls during the negotiation.  Your time is valuable, so aim for email or phone.

# DNA Electrophoresis

## General guide:
* Start with [addgene Agarose Gel Electrophoresis](https://www.addgene.org/protocols/gel-electrophoresis/)
* Modifications:
    * Use 1x LAB buffer instead of TAE or TBE buffer. We have a stock of 25x LAB buffer.  Dilute this 1:25 to yield a 1x solution (40 ml of 25X solution into 960 ml diH2O).  If buffer is transfered to a sealed container between gel runs, we can re-use the buffer many times. 
    * Always prepare agarose gels with un-used 1x LAB buffer. 
    * Prepare 0.8% agarose gels for standard applications (1.0 kb to 5 kb). If looking for larger or smaller fragments, adjust agarose concentration lower or higher. 
    * Add 2-3 ul of ethidium bromide solution to a 100 ml gel. Don't add extra EtBr to the running buffer. 
    * Use 1 Kb Plus DNA ladder
    * Always add DNA to a loading buffer before loading into a gel. (xxxNot sure what we'll use, but Ficoll based buffers apparently result in cleaner bands than glycerol based loading buffers)


## Run the Gel
* When using LAB buffer, you can run at over 30 V per cm gel length. (xxxFigure out what size gels we'll be using). 

## Visualize the Gel
* Carry gel in a secondary containment tray to room XXX.  Use the 1 glove-rule (touch gel with your non-dominant gloved hand.  Keep your dominant hand glove-free to open doors, use computer mice, etc without contaminating it). 
* xxx Add any info about the software quirks if necessary

## Clean-Up
* Discard DNA gel in the trash (xxxI think this is okay at Davis. We should check)
* Use a funnel to carefully pour used LAB buffer back into the "Used 1x LAB buffer" bottle, and seal it. Add a hash-mark to the label to indicate # of uses.  (xxx eventually we'll determine when to toss the buffer.)
* make sure gel comb is free of residual agar
* Clean up any other mess at the gel doc area

## Planning ahead
* Agarose gels can be pre-poured, solidified, wrapped in cellophane, and stored at 4C for up to 2 weeks.
